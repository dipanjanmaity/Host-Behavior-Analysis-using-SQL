- Analysis on the distinction between SUPER HOST and NORMAL HOST on different dimensions like acceptance rate, response rate, instant booking, profile picture, identity verification, review review scores, average number of bookings per month, etc.

- Analysis on how the comments of reviewers vary for listings of SUPER HOST vs. NORMAL HOST (by extracting words from the comments provided by the reviewers).

- Analysis on the average price and availability of the listings for the upcoming year between SUPER HOST and NORMAL HOST.

- Comparison between SUPER HOST vs NORMAL HOST for Large Property Listings.

- comparing how the aforementioned tendencies change between hosts located locally and hosts located elsewhere.

- Obtaining meaningful insights through the use of Excel charts.
